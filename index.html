                JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. It's an interpreted language that executes code line by line, providing more flexibility.

                Mostly browsers can run JavaScript directly, so there's no need to install a compiler. However, the built-in browser console isn’t very beginner-friendly. That’s why we’ve added an online editor below to help you get started easily.
